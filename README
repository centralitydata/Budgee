## The Municipal Budget App

Have you ever wondered how your municipality spends its money? Well, Budgee is
here to help!

Currently available for all of Alberta, the Budgee web app uses the official
Government of Alberta
[Municipal Financial & Statistical Data](http://www.municipalaffairs.alberta.ca/municipal_financial_statistical_data)
made available through the [Alberta Open Data Portal](http://data.alberta.ca/),
to generate intuitive interactive visualizations of municipal spending.

[Check it out in action by clicking here](http://budgee.meteor.com).


## Apps for Alberta

Budgee has been built as the
[Centrality Data Science](https://www.centrality.ca/)
entry to the [Apps for Alberta](http://data.alberta.ca/apps-for-alberta)
competition in Spring 2015.


## Beyond Alberta

Budgee has been built to accommodate data from any municipality, as long as it
is appropriately licensed for inclusion and can be wrangled into the appropriate
format.
If you are interested in having another jurisdiction added, or in helping to
acquire new data sets for them, please
[get in touch](http://budgee.meteor.com/contact).
